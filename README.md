## Overview
  This project was a combination of the knownledge I have gained in this course, with a bit of knowledge gained outside of the class.
  The subject of the project, the needed pages, and the text on the site were the only things given to us. The design, layout, and media we had to come up with and intergrate into the project.
  The orginal form submittion went to the instructor for the class. Now it is set up to have all submittions directed to me.
  This project is host on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
